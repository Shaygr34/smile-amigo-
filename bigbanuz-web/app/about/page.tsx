            The Story

            <p>
              I&apos;m Amit Banuz — a photographer who found his calling through
              an unconventional path. After serving as a combat soldier in the
              Israeli military, I experienced a motorcycle accident that changed
              my perspective on life. During recovery, I picked up a camera and
              never put it down.
            </p>
            <p>
              A transformative trip to Sri Lanka brought clarity to what I wanted
              my life to be about: capturing authentic moments and the raw energy
              of the ocean. Since then, I&apos;ve been shooting surf and events
              across the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Israel, and soon Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
              My approach is personal. Whether I&apos;m in the water with surfers
              or documenting your event, I focus on the real moments — the
              energy, the emotion, the connections. No forced poses. No
              artificial setups. Just life as it happens, through my lens.

            <p>
              I shoot in-water for surf — getting as close to the action as
              possible. For events, I blend into the crowd to capture natural
              reactions and genuine moments. My editing style is clean and
              cinematic, letting the subject speak for itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every shoot is a personal connection. I want to understand your
              vision, your energy, and what makes your moment unique. That&apos;s
              what shows up in the final images.
